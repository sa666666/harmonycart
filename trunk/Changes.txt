===========================================================================

1.3: (Aug. 13, 2013)

  * Fixed bug when saving DPC+ and Custom ROMs in single-cart mode; the
    ROM data wasn't actually being written to the device.

  * Added support for 29KB DPC+ ROMs in single-cart mode (ie, ones
    without any ARM code); these ROMs now have ARM code automatically
    added before being downloaded.

  * Updated bankswitch autodetection code to latest from Stella 3.9.1.

-Have fun!


1.2: (Dec. 20, 2012)

  * Updated lpc21isp code to version 1.85 (supports latest LPCxxxx chips).

  * Updated HBIOS and ARM files to latest version (1.05).

  * Added support for Custom ROMs (such as 32KB 'DPC+') with the ARM code
    already embedded.

  * The bankswitch autodetection now also uses the ROM filename
    extensions as defined in the Harmony manual; when present, these
    completely override the type of data in the ROM image.

  * Fixed crash when an 'F4' ROM couldn't be compressed; an error message
    is now shown.  Also improved compression function; at least one ROM
    that couldn't be compressed previously now works fine.

  * The location for 'ARM' files is now automatically determined based
    on where you've installed the application; right-clicking on the
    directory selection button will also set this location.

  * The Windows release now includes a commandline-based version
    which shows output on the commandline, and is meant to be run from
    the commandline only.

  * Fixed bugs in user interface (cut off text, progress bar not always
    appearing, etc).

  * The previously selected tab (BIOS or Development) is now used when the
    app starts.

  * Updated bankswitch autodetection code to latest from Stella 3.7.4.


1.1: (Dec. 11, 2009)

  * Added logging of download progress.  When activated, a dialog will
    appear after the download has completed, outlining what operations
    were performed.  This is useful for detecting errors in operation.

  * The Harmony cart autodetection is now done in a separate thread, so
    the UI won't lock up while autodetection is running.  This fixes
    problems where the app seems to be frozen during startup.

  * The various file request dialogs now remember the last location
    selected, so you don't need to 'drill down' to the same location
    multiple times.

  * When clicking on a ROM in the QuickPick list, the app now checks to
    see if the file exists.  If it doesn't, a dialog asks whether to
    remove it from the list.

  * Tooltips were added to all remaining UI items; this should make the
    app much easier to use.

  * Increased the time that messages are shown in the status bar from two
    to four seconds, so you have a better chance of reading the results.

  * Implemented 'Retry Count' menu setting, to configure how often a 
    write should be attempted before considering it a failure.

  * The download buttons are now disabled during an active download, to
    indicate another download isn't possible at this time.

  * Fixed several typos in the list of bankswitch types; some ROMs were
    being mislabeled.

  * Added support for OSX Snow Leopard.

  * Updated HBIOS and ARM files to latest version (1.03c).

  * Updated PAL50 version of eeloader.bin for better compatibility with
    A7800 PAL systems.


1.0: (Oct. 7, 2009)

  * Initial release for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.
