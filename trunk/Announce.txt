                 Release 1.2 for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows
===========================================================================

The Harmony cartridge is a programmable add-on for the Atari 2600 console
that allows you to load an entire library of games into a single cartridge
and then select which title you want to play from a friendly, on-screen
menu interface.  It features an SD card interface, making it simple to
access the large library of Atari 2600 software.  The Harmony cartridge
supports almost all of the titles that have been produced for the Atari
2600.  It can also be used to run your own Atari 2600 game creations on a
real console.  The Harmony cartridge is flash-upgradeable, and will be
updated to support future Atari 2600 developments.

The Harmony Programming Tool is a cross-platform application used to
program the Harmony Cartridge.  Both GUI and commandline usage is
supported.

This is the 1.2 release of HarmonyCart for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.
