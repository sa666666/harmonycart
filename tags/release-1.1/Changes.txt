===========================================================================

1.1: (Dec. 11, 2009)

  * Added logging of download progress.  When activated, a dialog will
    appear after the download has completed, outlining what operations
    were performed.  This is useful for detecting errors in operation.

  * The Harmony cart autodetection is now done in a separate thread, so
    the UI won't lock up while autodetection is running.  This fixes
    problems where the app seems to be frozen during startup.

  * The various file request dialogs now remember the last location
    selected, so you don't need to 'drill down' to the same location
    multiple times.

  * When clicking on a ROM in the QuickPick list, the app now checks to
    see if the file exists.  If it doesn't, a dialog asks whether to
    remove it from the list.

  * Tooltips were added to all remaining UI items; this should make the
    app much easier to use.

  * Increased the time that messages are shown in the status bar from two
    to four seconds, so you have a better chance of reading the results.

  * Implemented 'Retry Count' menu setting, to configure how often a 
    write should be attempted before considering it a failure.

  * The download buttons are now disabled during an active download, to
    indicate another download isn't possible at this time.

  * Fixed several typos in the list of bankswitch types; some ROMs were
    being mislabeled.

  * Added support for OSX Snow Leopard.

  * Updated HBIOS and ARM files to latest version (1.03c).

  * Updated PAL50 version of eeloader.bin for better compatibility with
    A7800 PAL systems.

-Have fun!


1.0: (Oct. 7, 2009)
